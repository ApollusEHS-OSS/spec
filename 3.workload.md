# 3. Workload Definition
**Target Audience: Infrastructure Operator** 

This section defines the workload definition schematics.

**Workload Definitions** are authored by an infrastructure operator or platform builder. A workload definition defines the kind of components that an application developer can use in application, along with the component's schema. 

The purpose of workload definitions is to provide a way for an infrastructure operator or platform builder to define what components are available to application developers on a given platform. Workload definitions can define custom schemas for any type of workload. Examples include container pods, serverless functions, data stores, message queues, or any other kind of workload that an application developer needs to design a complete application.

Usually, workload definitions are provided by the OAM runtime (just as traits are) so that application developers may inspect the OAM runtime and learn what workloads are available for use.  

## Top-Level Attributes

The following attributes are common across all schemata defined in this document. They follow the [Kubernetes specification](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields).

Here are the attributes that provide top-level information about the workload definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y | | The specific version of the specification in use. The core types use `core.oam.dev/v1alpha2` |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || The string `WorkloadDefinition` |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](#metadata) | Y | | WorkloadDefinition metadata. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y | | A container for the workload definition. |

### Metadata

The metadata describes this workload definition. The `metadata` section is defined in [the meta section of part 2](2.overview_and_terminology.md#Metadata)

### Spec

The specification section contains a reference to the workload definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `definitionRef` | [`DefinitionRef`](#DefinitionRef) | Y | | Workload schema reference. |


#### DefinitionRef

DefinitionRef defines an index to find the workload schema.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The workload schema's name. |

The workload schema definition itself __MUST__ contain information that can be used to uniquely identify it. An OAM runtime will use that information in a [Component](4.component.md) to refer to the workload schema instead of using the name of the workload definition.
 We recommend to use the format [Group/Version/Kind](2.overview_and_terminology.md#Group) described in section 2 as the unique identification in the schema. 

We recommend that the `name` here follows the format described in [the Representations of Group/Kind in section 2](2.overview_and_terminology.md#Representations).

We also recommend that the `name` of the WorkloadDefinition to be the same as the `name` it refers to. Here is an example

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: schema.example.oam.dev
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: schema.example.oam.dev
```

## Categories of Workload

There are three categories of workloads:

__Core workloads__ are the kind of workloads that every OAM runtime MUST implement according to spec definition.

__Standard workloads__ are the kind of workloads that a OAM runtime MAY implement. However, the implementation MUST strictly adhere to the schematics defined in the spec. 

__Extended workloads__ are the kind of workloads that a OAM runtime is free to define.

### Core Workload

A core workload schema MUST be in the `core.oam.dev` group. All implementations of OAM MUST implement all core workloads as defined in this specification. Here is an example of a core workload definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: x.core.oam.dev
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: x.core.oam.dev
```

### Standard Workload

A standard workload schema MUST be in the `standard.oam.dev` group. Implementations of OAM are NOT REQUIRED to implement standard workloads. However, if an implementations of OAM chooses to implemented a workload that is already defined by a standard workload, it SHOULD use the standard workload definition as defined in this specification. Here is an example of a standard workload definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: x.standard.oam.dev
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: x.standard.oam.dev
```

 
### Extended Workload
Each OAM runtime may define its own workload definition beyond this specification. Any workload definition that is not part of the **core** or **standard** group is considered an extended workload. The name and schema of extended workloads are entirely at the discretion of an implementation of OAM. Here is an example of an extended workload:


```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: foo.cache.io
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: foo.cache.io
```
      

## Core Workload definitions
The following core workloads are defined in our current OAM specification.

### Containerized Workload
A containerized workload is used for long-running workloads. Here is the [definition](core/workloads/containerized_workload/containerized_workload.md) of the containerized workload.
